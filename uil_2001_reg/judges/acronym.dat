The SSF FSS system
must be purged with
N2 during a DMC.
Seepage past the N2
dispersal nozzle
allows a buildup of
O2 in the FSS feeder
lines. When the SDT
detection system
issues a FSD CW to
FDIR, a command is
issued to the FSS
to disperse N2 to
the AR. If the FSS
lines have not been
purged, the fire
will be fanned with
O2 instead of being
extinguished with N2
leading to a possible
LCV event.
I really enjoyed working on the SM
CSCI for
IBM
on the NASA
SSF.
