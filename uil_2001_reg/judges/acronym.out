The Space Station Freedom Fire Suppression System system must be purged with
Nitrogen during a Daily Maintenance Cycle.
Seepage past the Nitrogen dispersal nozzle
allows a buildup of
Oxygen in the Fire Suppression System feeder
lines. When the Smoke/Fire, Rapid Depression, and Toxic Atmosphere detection system
issues a Fire/Smoke Detected Caution and Warning to Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery, a command is issued to the Fire Suppression System
to disperse Nitrogen to
the Affected Region. If the Fire Suppression System lines have not been
purged, the fire will be fanned with
Oxygen instead of being extinguished with Nitrogen leading to a possible
Loss of Crew and Vehicle event.
I really enjoyed working on the System Management Computer Software Configuration Item for International Business Machines Incorporated
on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Station Freedom.
