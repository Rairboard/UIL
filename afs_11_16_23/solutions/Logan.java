/*2018 UIL Invitational A - Logan
Logan collects valuables of all sorts, including marbles, jewels, rocks, whatever is of interest and value to him.
He keeps them in soft leather bags of different colors, and has marked each bag with
the weight, estimated value of the bag, and a general description of the contents.

He is about to load up a tote bag with as many of the colored bags as he can carry, 
to sell at the local flea market, but wants to maximize the value so that 
he can have the most value to sell. The tote bag has a weight limit he cannot exceed.

He needs your help in deciding which of the colored bags he should put
into the tote bag to get the most value to sell at the flea market.

For example, let's say that his tote bag has a weight capacity of 5 pounds,
and he has 3 colored bags, one that is blue, another red, and a third green.
The blue bag has a value of $5 and weighs 3 pounds, the red bag is worth $3 and 
weighs 2 pounds, and the green bag is worth $4 and only weighs 1 pound.
Altogether, the three bags weigh 6 pounds, too much to carry in the tote
bag, which means Logan must decide the best two bags to take.

He considers each combination.
The blue and red bags will fit, with a total weight of 5 pounds,
and a total value of $8. 

The red and green bags are not as good a combination,
with 3 pounds of weight, but only $7 value. 

The best combination is
blue and green, with a combined weight of only 4 pounds, but a value of
$9.

5 3 BLUE
3 2 RED
4 1 GREEN

He does have tote bags of varying weight capacities, some that can handle
up to 1000 pounds, and up to one hundred different colored bags
that contain various precious items. Depending on the tote bag he chooses,
and the bags he has in his current inventory, write a program that helps
Logan make the best decision about which colored bags to place in the
selected tote bag in order to maximize the value of his flea market inventory.

Assumptions: 
Tote bag weight range, 1 to 1000 pounds
Number of different colored bags, 1 to 100
Maximum value of any particular bag, $99,999

Input: The data file will contain an initial integer N, 
indicating N data sets to follow. Each data set consists of an 
integer T representing the total weight capacity of the tote bag,
an integer I indicating how many colored bags he has in inventory,
followed by I sets of data, each on one line consisting of three items, 
an integer V representing the total value of the bag in dollars,
an integer W indicating the weight of the bag in pounds, and the color of the bag.

Output: For each data set, list the original weight capacity of the bag,
how much of the weight capacity is used, the total value of the contents,
and the colors of the bags included, listed in original order as listed
in the data file. Each element of the output is shown on it own line.
