Mr. Michael Zimm

Asity, Texas 78923

This is a simple e-mail with 3 addresses in it.  However, your program
will only pick up on a couple of them.  For example, your program would
never be able to distinguish a line that had too many characters.  In fact,
Dr. Michaels, you cannot be assured that you will find all addresses no
matter how much you try.  Without the power of simple human intelligence,
I doubt if you will find even half of them.

Sincerely,

Mrs. Ima Hogg
