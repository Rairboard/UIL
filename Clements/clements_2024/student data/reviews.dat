This movie was an incredible experience.
I wish I could watch it again, it was brilliantly paced,
and the score was just masterful. The last scene especially
was just so unforgettably action-packed that I wish it had
gone on for another 30 minutes. Just a wonderful experience.
--------------------
This was a messy, enjoyable, brilliantly ridiculous masterpiece.
I have never been so confused, while entertained at the same time.
Major props to the writers and directors for an unforgettably 
flawed and far-fetched movie that tickled my brain.
