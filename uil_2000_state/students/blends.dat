LUBBOCK, Texas (Ticker) -- Texas Tech marched into its second straight "Sweet
16" as freshman Plenette Pierson led four players in double figures with 19
points en route to a 76-59 victory over Tulane in the Mideast Region.

Aleah Johnson, Katrisa O'Neal and Tanisha Ellison had 12 points apiece for
third-seeded Texas Tech (27-4), which plays No. 2 Notre Dame on Saturday in
Memphis, Tennessee.

The other "Sweet 16" matchup at Memphis will be top-seeded Tennessee and No.
4 Virginia.

Conference USA Player of the Year Grace Daley scored 24 points for Tulane
(27-5), which failed to set a school record for victories in a season. The
Green Wave have never advanced to the regionals.

The Lady Raiders used a pair of first-half runs to put away the Green Wave.
Ellison scored seven points during an 11-0 burst that gave Texas Tech a 22-16
lead with 7:24 to play before the break. But the key run started 2:48 before
intermission, when Pierson ignited a half-ending, 10-0 run with a jumper that
made it 36-24. Amber Tarr hit a 3-pointer with 24 seconds left and Keitha
Dickerson added one at the buzzer after a steal by Pierson.
